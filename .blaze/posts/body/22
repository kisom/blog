<p>A while ago, I made the mistake of using iTunes for my music library;
when I wanted to move my music from my interla hard drive to the external
drive, I ran into some issues. Namely, the migration (using the iTunes set
library location followed by a 'organise library') failed multiple times.
I ended up with lots of duplicate songs.</p>
<!-- break -->
<p>Most of my music directories looked like:
<pre>
02 Pyramid Song.mp3
02 Pyramid Song 2.mp3
02 Pyramid Song 3.mp3
03 Pulk_Pull Revolving Doors.mp3
03 Pulk_Pull Revolving Doors 1.mp3
03 Pulk_Pull Revolving Doors 2.mp3
</pre>
Some had no copies, others had between one and four copies. This made my
music library take up far more space than was necessary; what should have
only taken up 101G took up over three times that. I pared it down to twice
what it should have been but got tired of doing it by hand - after all,
computers are very userful for doing tedious work. So during a fit of
insomnia a few nights ago, I wrote up a quick bit of python to fix it. I
tested it repeatedly on single artist directories (which would give a large
enough sample space to play with) until I had it working like I wanted it
to (including preferring <tt>02 Pyramid Song.mp3</tt> over
<tt>02 Pyramid Song <i>n</i>.mp3</tt>. Then, I unleashed it on the full
library. During testing, I counted the removal of over 1100 songs (and that
was just during the time I was counting how many files were hit). The final
purging removed over 15,500 songs in two and a half hours.</p>
<p>The code is pretty simple, just over one hundred lines of python. You 
can take a look at it <a href="/blog/scripts/dedup.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: the link above is dead, but I have an updated version that uses 
tagging and it bigger (and uses a library I am working on to provide a simpler
interface to the python-mutagen library. It is available via 
<a href="https://github.com/kisom/pymusiclib">the github project page</a>.
