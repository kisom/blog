Hello, 
 
I got your contact through my search for a reliable person. I can trust. I have 
a burden that dwells with me at the moment, and I wish to settle this with you 
in trust and confidentiality. I would want us to work together like blood 
brothers. I am a war veteran with the United Nations troop in Afghanistan, on 
war against terrorism. I served in the 1st Armored Division in Kabul.

  
Based on the United States legislative and executive decision for withdrawing 
troops from Afghanistan come next year, I have been redeployed to come and work 
in Europe on the platform of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) soon. Our
mission is to help beef up terrorist targeted states, mostly the United States 
and the European Union on the war against terrorism. I will need a Vehicle to 
set up a construction company and other business and that is why I contacted 
you.
  
On the other hand, I would like to inform you that I have in my possession the 
sum of 9.7 million U.S. dollars equivalent in euro. I made from crude oil here 
in Iraq. I deposited this money with a Red Cross agent informed him that we will
contact the real owner of the money. It is under my power to approve who is 
eligible for this money.
  
I would invest the money in Europe as soon as you agree to keep this fund safe 
in Europe for business and other investment purposes through you, but you will 
advise me on that because I am not a business culture person.  I will be in 
Europe for about 4 years, so I need someone I could trust. If you accept, I will
move the fund to you, where you will be the beneficiary, because I am a 
uniformed person and I can not parade such an amount, so I need to present 
someone as the recipient. I'm an American and an officer for intelligence, that 
I have a 100% authentic means of transferring the money through diplomatic 
courier Service. I just need your acceptance, and everything is done. Please, 
if you are interested in this transaction, I give you the complete details you 
need for us to implement this transaction successfully. I decided to contact 
someone I could trust and real and not imaginary so I can be sure that the 
person is real. 

 
I think I can trust you, where we are now we can only communicate through our 
military facilities, communication is secured, so nobody can monitor our 
e-mails, and then I can explain in details to you. I will only reach you by 
e-mail, because our Calls might be monitored, I have to be sure; I have to deal 
with someone I could trust. If you are interested, please send me your personal 
mobile number so that the diplomat can call you for inquiries and how to bring 
the box that contains my money to you. If you are not interested, do not respond
to this e-mail and delete this Message if no response after 3 days, I will then 
search for someone else.
  
I wait for your contact information details, so that we can go on. In less than 
4 days the box should be in your possession, and I will come for my money. I 
will give you 30% of the total and 70% for me. I hope I have been fair to this 
deal. Get back to me with your full information:
   
  
Your full name..............................................
Your full address.......................................
Your direct phone number................
Your occupation.....................
  
Regards
Capt. James Crosby

I love the "against terrorism" part. Oh the fun that could be had with this!
Ideas that came immediately to mind are:
<ul>
<li>have him send me "classified documents" to prove his authenticity</li>
<li>ask if this is a wise idea with current wikileaks situation</li>
<li>ask how he knows his email isn't being monitored</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
