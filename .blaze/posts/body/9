<p>I was up until 6 AM working on the pmt2 project last night. The good news is
wireless signal strength functionality is working. dtx0 helped provide some
sanity checks and an extra set of eyes to look through code, so thanks dtx0!<p>
<!-- break -->
<p>I see the next steps as being:<br>
<ul>
	<li>audio functionality<br>
	<ul>
		<li>getting a simple tone to play</li>
		<li>adding in configurable functions to adjust device, sample 
		rates, etc...</li>
	</ul>
	<li>threading:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>the main program thread</li>
			<li>the wireless signal strength monitor</li>
			<li>the tone generator</li>
			<li>the user interface (probably ncurses-based)</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>user interface (probably ncurses)<br>
	<ul>
		<li>"graphical" signal strength indicator</li>
		<li>audio configuration</li>
		<li>NIC specification</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul></p>
<p>As you can see, there's a lot of stuff to still be done but I'm learning a
lot for this being such a pointless project otherwise. The project now has
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/thepmt2" alt="thepmt2">a sourceforge
project page</a> up featuring a git repo.</p>
