<p>I was working through the Hacking: Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition,
book source and playing with IDA to look at disassemblies of those files
(the best place to get back up to speed is to examine your own binaries).
I wanted to set up a VM so I could save state and keep an isolated system,
and keep a live CD around for portable work. Here is how I pulled it off.</p>
<!-- break -->

<p>I first tried using the <a href="http://www.linux-live.org">Linux Live
</a>scripts. After a lot work trying to figure out the system, including 
editing the tools/liblinuxlive script to make corrections to the mksquashfs
call, I finally was able to generate a 660M CD image. Except, that CD
image apparently didn't include the tools to read the squashfs root, so it
kernel panicked in the first five seconds of booting. I started looking
for some alternate options so I wasn't spending all my time trying to get
it working.</p>

<p>The most promising system that I came across in a five minute Google
search was <a href="http://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys/index.html">
remastersys</a> by Tony Brijeski. I already had a VirtualBox VM to 
build the live CD in running a Debian 5 install; the only two extra 
packages I added outside the base Debian repos (besides Remastersys) were 
Google Chrome and of course IDA Pro. I set up the system how I wanted it,
and ran <tt>remastersys backup</tt>, and was presented with a shiny
530M iso file. </p>

<p>Of course I wasn't going to get it perfect on the first try, so it's
an iterative process - I'm currently on revision 3. The moral of the
story is that if you want to build a live CD based on Debian, you
should definitely consider Remastersys.</p>
