i needed a project to recentre myself given the current load of inanity in my
life right now, and a project came up that should provide just that. 
essentially, i will be designing and building my own 16-bit computer based on
the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/).

the book is geared towards simulating the computer using the tools provided
(such as a hardware simulator based on their easy to learn / use HDL) but 
i've decided the project would be far more satisfying if i actually built the
computer. to that end, i'm having to do a lot more work designing the actual
NAND-based circuits. i've been learning a lot just in this first chapter,
and given that i don't know enough right now to pull this off, it should be
rewarding.

i have a git repository set up for the projects in the book on 
[a github repo](https://www.github.com/kisom/tecs) and the project has an
[additional github repo](https://www.github.com/kisom/percipio).

i will try to update progress here.
