<p>
i needed a project to recentre myself given the current load of inanity in my
life right now, and a project came up that should provide just that. 
essentially, i will be designing and building my own 16-bit computer based on
the book <a href="http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/">The Elements of Computing Systems</a>.</p>
<p>
the book is geared towards simulating the computer using the tools provided
(such as a hardware simulator based on their easy to learn / use HDL) but 
i've decided the project would be far more satisfying if i actually built the
computer. to that end, i'm having to do a lot more work designing the actual
NAND-based circuits. i've been learning a lot just in this first chapter,
and given that i don't know enough right now to pull this off, it should be
rewarding.</p>
<p>
i have a git repository set up for the projects in the book on 
<a href="https://www.github.com/kisom/tecs">a github repo</a> and the project has an
<a href="https://www.github.com/kisom/percipio">additional github repo</a>.</p>
<p>
i will try to update progress here.</p>
