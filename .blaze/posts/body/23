For a long time, building my personal site was painful, simply because I
didn't need (or want) a large framework or dynamic content or anything
fancy, just a few simple static pages. I was hand-writing them all, which
meant that given how little I enjoyed doing that, pages weren't ever really
getting updated and you can pretty much forget adding much in the way of new
content. I decided to do something about this, and spent a week or two 
writing <a href="http://rawk.brokenlcd.net">rawk</a>. </p>
<p>
rawk stands for 'rage against web frameworks' and what it does, in short, is
take a tree of markdown files and converts them to html files, adding in
headers, a site menu, and footers. <a href="http://www.kyleisom.net">My homepage</a> was
done in rawk, as are a number of my other personal sites. I envisioned being
able to quickly add in project documentation or update project pages on my
homepage.</p>
<p>
As it stands now, rawk is just under 90 lines of actual code (under around 140
lines when you count comments and whitespace). Being as it is a fairly simple
bit of code, mostly some cats wrapped in seds and greps, it does have a few 
limitations, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way rawk handles links could be improved,</li>
<li>the site-menu appears even when there is only the index file, and</li>
<li>no markdown parser is supplied with rawk, although not-so-subtle hints are 
made for <a href="http://s01.de/~tox/index.cgi/proj_smu">smu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I've got to sit down and tackle these problems, as well as look into possibly
extending rawk:</p>
<ul>
<li>image gallery generation (convert + templates + sed magic)</li>
<li>blogging system (replace blaze!?)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those are the two major things that I would like to see, and those might be
pushing the bounds of posix shell - an image gallery would almost certainly
require the use of an external tool like ImageMagick).</p>
<p>
Anyways, it's useful for me. Maybe you'll find it useful as well. The homepage
has all the information about rawk.</p>
