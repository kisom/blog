<p>I recently installed Debian squeeze on my eeepc (a subject for another
post). The install is a development install, and everyone knows one of the
most useful things for development is a feed of good music. I keep a small
music library on the machine and use <a href="http://cmus.sourceforge.net">
cmus</a>, a console mp3 player, to play music. Unfortunately, the version
installed in Debian Squeeze doesn't seem to support AAC. I set out to figure
out how to convert my AAC files to mp3 files.</p>
<!-- break -->
<p>I threw a quick search into DuckDuckGo for "debian convert m4a to mp3",
hoping the debian repos would have tasty treats for me. No such luck.
I did run into 
<a href="http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/Convert_m4a.html">
this article</a> which shows how to convert between the two using
<tt>faad</tt> and <tt>lame</tt>. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the LAME
binaries in the debian repos (lame, I know). I did find twolame, however.
A quick translation between the various options was neccessary, so I 
tweaked the script by Graham Williams. I ended up with the following, using
the twolame and faad packages in the squeeze repos:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

BITRATE=192

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
    BITRATE=$1
fi

echo "bitrate: ${BITRATE}"

for i in *.m4a
do
    echo "converting $i"
    faad -o - "$i" | twolame -r -b $BITRATE - "${i%m4a}mp3"
done
</pre>
</p>
<p>One word of advice - this encoding process doesn't fill tags. I use
easytag for tagging, but use whatever works for you. Once this is done,
you can remove the original .m4as if you wish. Earfood ready for consumption!
