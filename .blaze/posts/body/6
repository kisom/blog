<p>I started writing a guide to OpenBSD's pf guide. Courtesy of qbit, vlado,
and carmel, I've got a number of topics to cover including: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>anchors</li>
<li>bandwidth limiting</li>
<li>OpenBGP load balancing</li>
<li>server load balancing</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The guide will be updated  
<a href="http://kisom.devio.us/openbsd/pf_guide.txt" alt="pf_guide.txt">here
</a>; it's far from being ready for general dissemination but if you'd care to 
proofread it, I'd appreciate feedback to either my
<a href="emailto://kisom@devio.us" alt="devio.us email">devio.us email</a> 
or <a href="mailto://kyle@kyleisom.net" alt="personal email">personal
email</a> address. It mostly gets written between 01:00 and 05:00 so I'm sure 
there's plenty of errors. At this point, I'm mostly interested in dumping 
information and then proofreading it later but I'm not opposed to getting 
feedback before it's finished.
</p>
<p>
It's being written in vim, so it's much easier to deal with than the Beginner's
Guide (being written in OpenOffice).
