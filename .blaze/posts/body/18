<p>I recently purchased a Global Scale Technologies Guru Server Plus
to use as a sort of rogue-box system for security research and CTF games.
Braving my distaste for Linux, I installed Debian on the box using
Bernd Zeimetz's excellent article 
<a href="http://bzed.de/posts/2010/05/installing_debian_on_the_guruplug_server_plus/">
Installing Debian on the Guruplug Server Plus</a>. I ended up installing
twice due to deviations from the instructions; the instructions <strong>do
</strong> work when followed. You will need a JTAG adapter to
install Debian. I'm not sure how well these instructions will apply to
the default version of linux that ships on the plug, so your mileage
may vary.</p>

<i>The sniffer with the JTAG/serial interface attached.</i>
<br><br>

<p>The first snag came when I tried to set up the wireless interface. It
uses the libertas firmware from Marvell; the drivers can be found in
<tt>/lib/firmware/mrvl</tt> on the original plug root filesystem (conveniently 
available as a download at 
<a href="http://plugcomputer.org/index.php/us/resources/downloads?func=fileinfo&id=77">from the plugcomputer.org site</a>. Extract the tarball to a
temp directory and copy the /lib/firmware/mrvl directory to the Debian 
install on the Guru. You may also have to load the kernel module
<tt>libertas_sdio</tt> (I got this via <tt>apt-get install 
libertas-firmware</tt>). The firmware should load on boot now, and the 
wireless card will show up as <tt>wlan0</tt>.</p>
<p>You will want to install the <tt>bridge-utils</tt> and <tt>tcpdump</tt> 
packages. The man page for <tt>brctl</tt> is practically useless, as it 
displays the wrong syntax for at least one command - don't take it too 
seriously. I wrote two scripts that execute on start - one sets up the bridge 
interface, essentially doing <br>
<tt><pre>
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0
brctl addbr br0
brctl addif eth0
brctl addif eth1
ifconfig br0 up
</pre></tt><br>
This script then calls a second script to start up the wireless interface
as a wireless client (for remote access). Lastly, the first script
backgrounds a tcpdump capture on <tt>br0</tt>, writing to the 16G root 
filesystem.  </p>
<p><i>Hacking the scripts</i>:<br>
The scripts are fairly straightforward, and assume the following conditions:
<br>
	<ol>
	<li>the bridge is being inserted between a router and modem,</li>
	<li>the sniffer will use a wireless interface in client-mode to server
	as a management interface,</li>
	<li>all traffic should be captured, and</li>
	<li>there won't be any frames larger than 1600 bytes</li>
	</ol>
If your needs vary, you should keep your conditions in mind if you're going off
this guide.</p>
<p>For <tt>bridge-sniff.sh</tt>, if no management interface is wanted 
<tt>$MAN_SH</tt> can be set to whatever, but set <tt>${MANAGE}</tt> to 
<tt>0</tt>. This script should be called from 
<tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> so that it can be triggered on boot.</p>

<p><tt>wicli.sh</tt> is similarly straightforward - change <tt>${WLAN}</tt> and 
<tt>NWID</tt> to your
network's / machine's settings. If need be, add in your WEP/WPA authentication.
If you wish to filter access to the management interface by MAC address, set
the <tt>MACFILTER</tt> variable to <tt>1</tt> and set the <tt>MACADDR</tt> 
variable to the management machine's interface MAC.</p>

<p>Other ideas include setting up the wireless as an access point or using a
3G connection for access. As for the guru platform, it has been a real
headache to work with. Unless you <strong>need</strong> built in wireless
and dual NICs, I would recommend going with the Sheeva platform, which I
have had great success with.</p>
