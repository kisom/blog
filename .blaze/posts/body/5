<p>Started working on a new program to dump GPS NMEA data into a GPX file.</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to tag photos with gpscorrelate but I didn't have an easy
way to generate the required GPX files. Today I began work on gps2gpx, which
is just a program that plugs various CPAN modules together to give me what 
I want. Eventually I'll throw together a TCL interface for it as well. It
will be win.</p>

online</a> as a plaintext file.</p>
