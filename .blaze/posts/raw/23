For a long time, building my personal site was painful, simply because I
didn't need (or want) a large framework or dynamic content or anything
fancy, just a few simple static pages. I was hand-writing them all, which
meant that given how little I enjoyed doing that, pages weren't ever really
getting updated and you can pretty much forget adding much in the way of new
content. I decided to do something about this, and spent a week or two 
writing [rawk](http://rawk.brokenlcd.net). 

<!-- break -->

rawk stands for 'rage against web frameworks' and what it does, in short, is
take a tree of markdown files and converts them to html files, adding in
headers, a site menu, and footers. [My homepage](http://www.kyleisom.net) was
done in rawk, as are a number of my other personal sites. I envisioned being
able to quickly add in project documentation or update project pages on my
homepage.

As it stands now, rawk is just under 90 lines of actual code (under around 140
lines when you count comments and whitespace). Being as it is a fairly simple
bit of code, mostly some cats wrapped in seds and greps, it does have a few 
limitations, namely:

* the way rawk handles links could be improved,
* the site-menu appears even when there is only the index file, and
* no markdown parser is supplied with rawk, although not-so-subtle hints are 
made for [smu](http://s01.de/~tox/index.cgi/proj_smu).

I've got to sit down and tackle these problems, as well as look into possibly
extending rawk:

* image gallery generation (convert + templates + sed magic)
* blogging system (replace blaze!?)

Those are the two major things that I would like to see, and those might be
pushing the bounds of posix shell - an image gallery would almost certainly
require the use of an external tool like ImageMagick).

Anyways, it's useful for me. Maybe you'll find it useful as well. The homepage
has all the information about rawk.
