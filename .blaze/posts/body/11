<p>I have way too many projects right now... currently working on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the pmt2 project</li>
	<li>spamninja (with n1nja and chrisn)</li>
	<li>a massive system/network architecture project for a business 
	idea</li>
	<li>at some point, I need to learn how to do the MP part of OAMP, 
	eventually s/php/perl::catalyst/</li>
	<li>finding a job</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't help that I keep getting distracted by stuff, or make stupid 
errors like including the wrong header. Eventually I'll get through it all.
