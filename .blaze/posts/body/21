<p>I wanted to set up mutt to work with gmail. Here's a quick post talking
about what you need to have to get IMAP and SMTPS working with mutt. For
reference, I've been using my google apps email and not just a plain 
gmail address.</p>
<!-- break -->
<p>You will need to make sure you have <tt>mutt</tt> and 
<tt>libsasl2-modules</tt> installed on debian, as mutt uses SASL for the 
smtps connection. I've used both <tt>mutt</tt> and <tt>mutt-patched</tt>
so it doesn't matter which of those you use.</p>
<p>Edit your <tt>~/.mutt/muttrc</tt> file. You need to at a minimum provide
an <tt>imap_user</tt>, i.e. 
<pre>
set imap_user = 'your_gmail_address'
</pre>
for gmail addresses or
<pre>
set imap_user = 'you@your_custom_domain'
</pre>
if you are using google apps. Then, set your spoolfile:
<pre>
set spoolfile = imaps://imap.gmail.com:993/INBOX
</pre>
and set your smtp_url:
<pre>
set smtp_url = 'smtp://your_gmail_address@smtp.gmail.com:587'
</pre>
If you are using google apps, obviously change <tt>your_gmail_address</tt>
to <tt>you@your_custom_domain</tt>. You also need to add
<pre>
set folder = 'imaps://imap.gmail.com:993'
</pre>
</p>
<p>Using this set up, I have been able to use mutt to check my google mail.
