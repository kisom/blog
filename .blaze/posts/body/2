<p>I decided I would use this blog to update progress on the beginner's guide.
</p>
<p>Currently, I have finished 5 chapters:<br>
0x01 . Connecting to the Server<br>
0x02 . First Steps in the Shell<br>
0x03 . Creating a Quick Homepage<br>
0x04 . tmux, the terminal multiplexer, and irssi, the best console IRC client EVAR<br>
0x05 . Installing Software into Your Home Directory<br>
</p>

<p>I am currently working on the chapter on uploading files to the account,
which should be a fairly short section.</p>

<p>Following that, I will cover SSH keys, some advanced shell stuff like shell
variables, and end with basic shell scripting.</p>
