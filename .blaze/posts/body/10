<p>So the next two posts have been about this "Poor Man's Theremin" project
and I've gotten a few questions as to why I'd even care about such a project.
I guess it's story time to explain how it came to be and why I'm working on it.

<p>The most common first question I get is, what's a theremin? Fortunately,
there's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin" alt="wikipedia
article">wikipedia article</a> on the instrument; you can check out a 
<a href="http://video.ted.com/talks/podcast/PameliaKurstin_2002.mp4" 
alt="TED theremin video">TED video of Pamelia Kurstin playing a theremin</a>.
It's a pretty interesting musical instrument. So what does this have to do 
with me? To explain will require some background, so I will step back a
little and explain the context.</p>
<p>For the past two years, I've been subscribed to the local defcon group's 
mailing list, fully intending to show up to a meeting but never quite making
it. I kept meaning too, even emailed for directions a few times, but never 
ended up making it down. Last night, I finally made it to a meeting. The topic
was on wireless triangulation using two laptops and was pretty interesting.
The premise was that based on the known position of two (or more) laptops,
you could figure out approximately where a third laptop was. As I'm sure most
people who have looked into such things know, there's a lot of fluctuation
in wireless signal strength as a result of complex factors of the various 
properties of electromagnetic waves. The talk discussed a little bit about
averaging, and we spent a few minutes discussing better ways to average out
the signal strength to get a more accurate feel for how far the laptop was.
The talk turned to using GPS in conjunction to include mapping, and then
another member of the group brought up the fact that the flucuations in signal
had once been turned into a music instrument. The original poor man's theremin
appeared in a <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6597" alt="Linux
Journal article on the Poor Man's Theremin">January 2003 Linux Journal article
on the Poor Man's Theremin</a>. I pulled up the page and started looking at the
code.</p>
<p>I have to admit, the code is a little crufty and I didn't really like the
coding style. The original PMT couples a C program to generate tones with a
shell script to monitor signal strength. As it stood, the shell script didn't
work and I had to add in another cut statement to the grep pipeline to get
the data we were looking for. Still, no sound. I think this is due to the 
current state of audio in Linux, and in the vast changes that have occurred in
the past 7 years. I spent a lot of the meeting trying to tweak it to work but
was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p>It got me thinking though, and I began thinking to myself about several
improvements I could make to the program. First of all, I would much prefer
the entire program be written in C to avoid finangling with multiple
interpreters and software systems. Second, the audio would have to be brought
into modernity. Finally, I began thinking that perhaps threads would benefit 
the program. I set out to begin coding it.</p>
<p>As you can see from the next two posts, it has been a rough start. I don't
claim to be a master of C or even that great of a C coder anymore. You don't
get any better by not coding, and who knows, maybe this code will entertain 
someone, inspire them to learn to code more fluently, and maybe get people
to hack just to satisfy that curious itch. (My last C program was a simple 
image identifer that determined the format of a image based on the first two
bytes of the file and I wrote it to satisfy another long-story itch.) We'll
see how this goes...</p>
