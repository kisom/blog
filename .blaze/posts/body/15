<p>With my new job I decided to break out IDA Pro again and relearn the art
of disassembly (and therefore the art of assembly) again, despite the fact
that I don't work with the x86 platform.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I copied the ida directory to /usr/idapro and set up the proper symlink
(/usr/bin/idapro -> /usr/idapro/idal64), and then ran idapro in excited
anticipation. Except one little problem:<br><br><tt>
&lt;straylight: ~> $ idapro<br>
zsh: no such file or directory<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Turns out my copy was linked against the 32-bit version of glibc. Once
I installed that, I was greeted by IDA pro working:<br>
