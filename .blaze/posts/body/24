<p>
I just started reading the book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920010883/">Learning Android</a>.
The book relies heavily on using the Eclipse IDE, but as we know Eclipse is
proof that Shaitan hates us and wants us to be miserable, I'm working through
the book using netbeans. I'm going to try to start documenting my adventures
working with android in netbeans. The interested can follow along.</p>
